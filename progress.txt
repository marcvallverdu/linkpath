[2026-01-31] Story-001 scaffolded Next.js 15 app router, Tailwind v4 wiring, shadcn Button, Convex client provider, ESLint + Prettier, strict TS. Added core config files, hello world page, Convex schema stub, and example env.
- npm install timed out due to registry/network; typecheck failed because tsc not installed.

[2026-01-31] Story-002 implemented full Convex schema with auth tables, MVP entities, indexes, and featureFlags.

[2026-01-31] Story-003 implemented Convex Auth (manually, not by Codex — it got stuck researching).
- Created convex/auth.ts with Google + Password providers
- Created convex/http.ts with auth HTTP routes
- Created middleware.ts with route protection (dashboard protected, login/signup redirect if authed)
- Updated providers.tsx to use ConvexAuthNextjsProvider
- Created login + signup pages with Google OAuth + email/password forms
- Types pass clean

[2026-01-31] Story-003 REDONE: Swapped from Convex Auth to Better Auth (@convex-dev/better-auth).
- convex/app.config.ts registers Better Auth component
- convex/auth.ts uses betterAuth() with Google + email/password
- convex/http.ts registers auth routes
- lib/auth-client.ts and lib/auth-server.ts for React/Next.js
- app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts proxies auth to Convex
- Login + signup pages use authClient.signIn/signUp
- Removed old middleware.ts (Better Auth handles differently)
- Note: convex/_generated/ types don't exist yet (need `npx convex dev`), so tsc will show errors for convex/ files. This is expected.
